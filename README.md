## USER STORY
--------------
```
AS an out of shape quarantined User

I WANT a recipe based  on an ingredient I specify.

Also

I WANT nutrition facts for the recipe 

SO THAT I can monitor how healthy the meal is

GIVEN that I know an ingredient,

WHEN I search for recipes

THEN I receive a list of applicable recipes

THEN I can save recipes to my profile

WHEN I revisit the site I can view my saved recipes and 
nutrition facts for those recipe

When I click on a saved recipe, 

I see a modal with the recipe information and nutrition facts.
```
## How It Works

Cooking**NTRL** is a website where people can search multiple cooking websites at once for recipes that include ingredients they specify in the search bar. 

When I search for ingredients I get a list of recipes that use said ingredient

And when im shown the list I can save each recipe to **MyCookbook** or visit the website to see how to make it

When i go back to the site my saved recipes should be in **MyCookbook** and when I click on it im shown more information
