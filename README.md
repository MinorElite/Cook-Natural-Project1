USER STORY
--------------
As an out of shape quarantine user

I want a app that based on the ingredients I specify give me a recipe

Also 

I want nutritional information on each recipe I select

So that i can monitor how healthy the meal is 

Given the ingredients I select

When i Search an ingredient 

Then i recieve a list of applicable recipes

Then i can save each recipe to my profile

When i revisit the site i can view my saved recipes

And when i clicked on a saved recipe 

I can view additional information on my selected recipe.

How it works

When I search for ingredients I get a list of recipes that use said ingredient

And when im shown the list I can save each recipe to my cookbook or visit the website to see how to make it

When i go back to the site my saved recipes should be in my cookbook and when I click on it im shown more information
