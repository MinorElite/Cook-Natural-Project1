# Cooking NTRL
User Story

AS a health conscious cook,
I WANT a recipe based on ingredients I specify

Also,

I WANT nutritional facts for the recipe
SO THAT I can monitor how healthy my meal is

GIVEN that I know which ingredient I want my meal to have
AND I know how many servings I want when I search for recipes. 
I receive a list of applicable recipes

THEN I can save recipes to my profile
WHEN I revisit the site, I can view my saved recipes and information
WHEN I click on the modal, I see nutrition facts
